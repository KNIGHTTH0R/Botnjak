# Botnjak

__Botnjak__ is a twitter bot that will search for the word "bosanac" in any tweet and reply to it with "bo≈°njak*". If you're from Bosnia, you'll get the point (which doesn't mean that this bot isn't pointless).

Follow [this account](https://twitter.com/botnjak), and I hope he'll soon be up and running doing what he has to.
